    <h1 style="color: bisque; border-style: dotted; background-color: brown; text-align: center;">Welcome to my Website!</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center;"> Hello! My name is Kwesi Asante, and I wanted to make a website about music. Here, you'll be able to look at some of my favorite artists, some recomendations, and if I have time, some links to some of my favorite playlists! I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>


<h2 style="color: bisque; border-style: dotted; background-color: brown; text-align: center;"> Favorite Artists</h2> 

<p style="text-align: center;"> While I have a bunch of favorite artists, I do think I can narrow it down to a top three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> For my top three favorite artists, it would have to be MAVI, Lauryn Hill, and Steve Lacy. </p>
<h3 style="color: bisque; border-style: dotted; background-color: brown; text-align: center;"> Music Reccomendations</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"> When it comes to Music recomendations, I got you. I listen to large amount of genere's of music, with a few specific ones I choose to stay away from (Country being an example.) </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> I listen to trap a lot, and if I were to recommend any artists, it would have to be: Pi'erre Bourne, Uno the Activist, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">For Underground Rap, It would have to be Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, Autumn! and KanKan.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">On the other side of rap, we have more jazzy type musicians, and for that, I'd have to reccomend Earl Sweatshirt, MIKE, MAVI, and Smino.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks for looking at my website! I'd give more reccomendations and choose some better artists that are less known, but I'm out of time. Thanks again!</p>
